### Project Description
Medigo is a centralized medicine search and pharmacy management system that allows users to locate medicines by name, composition, and location. The platform supports inventory management for pharmacies and issue reporting for effective admin control

### The Problem statement
There is no centralized platform that provides real-time information on medicine availability in nearby pharmacies. This leads to wasted time, delays in treatment, and poor coordination between users, pharmacies, and administrators.

### The Solution
Medigo provides a centralized, location-based platform where users can search for medicines by name and composition in nearby pharmacies. Pharmacies can register and manage their medicine inventory in real time, while users can report issues directly to the admin, enabling accurate information, faster access to medicines, and better system monitoring.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

**For Software:**
- Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL were used to develop the Medigo web application.
- Frameworks used: The project is developed using core PHP with custom CSS and vanilla JavaScript, without relying on external frameworks.
- Libraries used: The project uses built-in PHP libraries such as MySQLi, password hashing, and sessions, along with JavaScript DOM APIs for client-side interactions.
- Tools used: The project was developed using XAMPP for server setup, VS Code for coding, phpMyAdmin for database management, and web browsers for testing.

This screen shows the Pharmacy Dashboard of the Medigo system. It provides a quick overview of the pharmacy’s inventory status, including the total number of medicines, total stock value, low-stock count, and expired medicines. The dashboard also includes action buttons to add new medicines and view/manage existing medicines, enabling pharmacies to efficiently control their inventory from a single interface.
